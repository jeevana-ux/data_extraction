Hi Charmi,
There is a mismatch in CI raised in below 2 points:
For MRPs 2599, 1399, 1998 and 749 - upto 32% is accomodative of 8% promo support without any additional
supports as in last year's TOT , Hence all CIs for promos 30% is deducted - Rs 38K
We dont have any MRP 439 pack due which we cant provide any support - hence deducted 4K
Final claims amount - Rs 19611874
